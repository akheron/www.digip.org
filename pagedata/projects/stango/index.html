<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  <em>Stango</em> is a Pythonic static web site generator that feels
  like a web framework.
</p>
<p>
 User defined view functions generate the content to pages (e.g.
  using <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/">Jinja2</a> templates or
  any other means). During development, the pages are served locally
  using a built-in web server with all URLs working. When they site is
  ready, it is rendered to flat files and can be pushed to a
  production server.
