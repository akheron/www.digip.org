Version 1.2
===========

Released 2010-01-21

* New functions:

  - `json_equal()`: Test whether two JSON values are equal
  - `json_copy()` and `json_deep_copy()`: Make shallow and deep copies
    of JSON values
  - Add a version of all functions taking a string argument that
    doesn't check for valid UTF-8: `json_string_nocheck()`,
    `json_string_set_nocheck()`, `json_object_set_nocheck()`,
    `json_object_set_new_nocheck()`

* New encoding flags:

  - ``JSON_SORT_KEYS``: Sort objects by key
  - ``JSON_ENSURE_ASCII``: Escape all non-ASCII Unicode characters
  - ``JSON_COMPACT``: Use a compact representation with all unneeded
    whitespace stripped

* Bug fixes:

  - Revise and unify whitespace usage in encoder: Add spaces between
    array and object items, never append newline to output.
  - Remove const qualifier from the ``json_t`` parameter in
    `json_string_set()`, `json_integer_set()` and `json_real_set`.
  - Use ``int32_t`` internally for representing Unicode code points
    (int is not enough on all platforms)

* Other changes:

  - Convert ``CHANGES`` (this file) to reStructured text and add it to
    HTML documentation
  - The test system has been refactored. Python is no longer required
    to run the tests.
  - Documentation can now be built by invoking ``make html``
  - Support for pkg-config


Version 1.1.3
=============

Released 2009-12-18

=============

Released 2009-11-08

* Fix a bug where an error message was not produced if the input file
  could not be opened in `json_load_file()`

  digit after it
* Remove an unneeded include of ``stdint.h`` in ``jansson.h``


Version 1.1.1
=============

Released 2009-10-26
