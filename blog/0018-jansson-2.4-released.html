<p>
  <a href="/jansson/">Jansson</a> 2.4 has been released. This release
  adds new features and fixes a few bugs and documentation issues. It
  also adds support for building the library on Microsoft Visual
  Studio. The full release notes are
  available <a href="/jansson/doc/2.4/changes.html#version-2-4">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>New features</h3>
<p>
  A new macro, <a href="/jansson/doc/2.4/apiref.html#json_boolean">json_boolean()</a>,
  was added. It returns either the JSON true or JSON false value based
  on its argument. It's useful in situations like this:
</p>
<pre class="highlight c">json_t *value;
int yes = read_value_from_somewhere();
value = json_boolean(yes);  /* false if yes == 0, true otherwise */
</pre>
<p>
  It's now possible to decode JSON with a callback providing the
  source JSON text. The
  new <a href="/jansson/doc/2.4/apiref.html#json_load_callback">json_load_callback()</a>
  function calls a callback repeatedly to read the source JSON. This
  is useful when the JSON data is received from a custom stream, for
  example.
</p>
<p>
  JSON allows, but doesn't require, escaping <code>/</code> characters
  with <code>\/</code>. This is useful when JSON is embedded in a
  HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, because the
  string <code>&lt;/</code> must not occur inside
  a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. When using the
  new <code>JSON_ESCAPE_SLASH</code> encoding flag, Jansson now
  escapes <code>/</code>'s for you.
</p>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<p>
  Until now, it has been possible to make Jansson produce invalid JSON
  by creating a real value with an Inf or NaN special
  value. <a href="/jansson/doc/2.4/apiref.html#json_real">json_real()</a>
  and <a href="/jansson/doc/2.4/apiref.html#json_real_set">json_real_set()</a>
  now check for these special values and refuse to accept them,
  returning -1 to signal an error. (As a matter of
  fact, <code>json_real_set()</code> returned 0 even on other errors,
  and this was fixed, too.)
</p>

<h3>Windows support</h3>
<p>
  It's now possible to build Jansson on Windows with Microsoft Visual
  Studio. All the build errors have been fixed, and solution and
  project files for Visual Studio 2010 are included in
  the <code>win32/vs2010/</code> directory in the source distribution.
