<p>
  For some time now, I've been unsatisfied with the state of user
  names and passwords for the numerous services I use in the web. I'm
  having hard time to remember all the services I have singed up to
  and a bad habit of using a few common passwords for all of them.
</p>
<p>
  So, I hacked for a while, and yestreday, I pushed the first release
  of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sala">sala</a> to PyPI. It's
  is a simple, filesystem based, encrypted password storage system
  that uses <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>'s symmetrical
  encryption. As usual, a git repository
  is <a href="https://github.com/akheron/sala">available at
  GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The main idea of sala is to store passwords (or other tiny,
  plain-text secrets) in encrypted plain-text files in a directory
  hierarchy, like this:
</p>
<pre>/path/to/passwords
|-- example-service.com
|   |-- +webmail
|   |   |-- @myuser
|   |   `-- @otheruser
|   `-- +adminpanel
|       `-- @admin
`-- my-linux-box
    |-- @myuser
    `-- @root
</pre>
<p>
  As sala is a command line utility and there's one file per password,
  tab completion and other shell goodies are available. The custom of
  prefixing user names with <code>@</code> and
  category/group/subservice names with <code>+</code> is my own
  preference and not enforced by the program. You may come up with
  your own scheme, for example if you want to protect user names as
  well as the actual passwords. For more information, see
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sala">the PyPI page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Use <code>pip install sala</code> to install,
  or <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sala#downloads">download the
  source</a>, unpack, and invoke <code>python setup.py install</code>.
  In addition to Python 2.5 or newer, requires <code>gpg</code>
  and <a href="http://py-gnupg.sourceforge.net/">GnuPGInterface</a>.
  Currently, Python 3 is not supported because GnuPGInterface doesn't
  support it.

  <b>Update:</b> While writing this blog entry, I found a few
  packaging bugs, and released version 1.0.1.
