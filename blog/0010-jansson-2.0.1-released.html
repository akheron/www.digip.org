<p>
  Jansson 2.0.1 is out. This release fixes a few bugs, some of them
  major and some minor.
</p>
<p>
  The most important bug fixes are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix strict key checking in <code>json_unpack()</code> code. The
    strict mode (<code>JSON_STRICT</code> flag and the <code>!</code>
    format character), checking that every object key is unpacked,
    didn't really work at all.</li>
  <li>Fix the return value of <code>json_object_size()</code>. On
    error, it now returns 0, as documented. This may affect users if
    someone is relying on the buggy old return value
    of <code>(size_t)-1</code>.</li>
  <li>Fix a few segfaulters when custom memory management is
    used.</li>
  <li>Make the <code>JANSSON_VERSION_HEX</code> constant usable (by
    fixing the number of closing parentheses).</li>
</ul>
