<p>
  <a href="/jansson/">Jansson</a> 2.5 was released a few days ago. It
  was almost a year since last release, and a lot has happened during
  this time. In this post, I'll sum up the most important new
  features. For a more comprehensive list of changes, see
  the <a href="http://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.5/changes.html#version-2-5">release
  notes</a>.
</p>

<h3>New format specifiers</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.5/apiref.html#json_pack">json_pack()</a>
  and friends learned new format
  specifiers: <code>s#</code>, <code>+#</code> and <code>+#</code>.
  All of them deal with packing strings, and they work with both
  object keys and string values.
</p>
<p>
 The <code>s#</code> format lets you define a length of a substring to
  be packed. Example:
</p>
<pre class="highlight c">
const char *data = "abcdef";
json_pack("{s#: s#", data, 3, data + 3, 3);
/* ==> {"abd": "def"} */
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>+</code> format makes it possible to concatenate strings
  on the fly easily. It only works after a <code>s</code> or
  a <code>+</code>, and has the effect of joining the given string to
  the previous string:
</p>
<pre class="highlight c">
json_pack("{s+: s++}", "abc", "def", "foo", "bar", "baz");
/* ==> {"abcdef": "foobarbaz"} */
</pre>
<p>
  And <code>+#</code> is of course for concatenating a substring.
  Here's a more complex example that shows that the new format
  specifiers can be mixed in any way you can think of:
</p>
<pre class="highlight c">
const char *data = "abcdef";
json_pack("{s+#+: s#+#", "fed", data, 3, data + 3,
                         data, 1, data, 2);
/* ==> {"fedabcdef": "aab"} */
</pre>
<p>
  The new format specifiers are a response for two types of user needs
  that are discussed regularly
  on <a href="https://github.com/akheron/jansson">GitHub</a>
  and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jansson-users">mailing
  list</a>: Creating string values from non-NUL terminated buffers by
  specifying a length, and making it easier to work with strings
  directly in Jansson without having to do the C level plumbing
  yourself. <code>s#</code> solves the first need, and <code>+</code>
  and <code>+#</code> help with a common use case of concatenating two
  strings, although they're definitely not a magic bullet for every
  string manipulation need.
</p>
<p>
  There's also a good reason why these operations were implemented as
  an extension to <code>json_pack()</code> and not API functions of
  their own. Creating a new API function for every combination of
  possible string operations, encoding control, allocation schemes,
  etc. would need a vast amount of string functions. Extending all of
  this to object keys would make the situation three times worse.
</p>

<h3>CMake build system</h3>
<p>
  Support for <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> was perhaps the
  single most requested feature for a long time. While GNU Autotools,
  Jansson's default build system, generally works well on Unix-like
  platforms, many people find CMake generally better and easier to
  use. It also has better support for non-Unix systems, namely
  Windows.
</p>
<p>
  GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a>,
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>
  and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a> still
  stay the default build system for Jansson. However, the CMake build
  system is complete in a sense that it does everything that the
  autotools build system does (generates documentation, runs tests,
  etc.).
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/paulharris">Paul
  Harris</a> for initially developing the CMake support, and
  to <a href="https://github.com/JoakimSoderberg">Joakim SÃ¶derberg</a>
  for finishing the work and correcting many bugs and feature requests
  afterwards.
</p>

<h3>Smaller features</h3>
<p>
  A new decoding flag <code>JSON_DECODE_INT_AS_REAL</code> was added.
  It makes the decoder return all numbers as reals, regardless of
  whether their text representation
  contains <code>.</code>, <code>e</code> or <code>E</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.5/apiref.html#json_array_foreach"><code>json_array_foreach()</code></a>
  macro was added, paralleling
  <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.5/apiref.html#json_object_foreach"><code>json_object_foreach()</code></a>.
  Even though a loop over an array is easier to create, this macro
  makes it even simpler and better looking to iterate over an array:
</p>
<pre class="highlight c">
json_t *array;  /* holds an array */
size_t index;
json_t *value;
json_array_foreach(array, index, value) {
    /* index is the current position of iteration,
       value is the JSON value at that position.
    */
}
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>struct json_t</code> can now be forward declared. This
  makes it possible to avoid including <code>&lt;jansson.h&gt;</code>
  in header files that declare global <code>json_t *</code> variables
  or funtions whose signature uses <code>json_t *</code>.
</p>
