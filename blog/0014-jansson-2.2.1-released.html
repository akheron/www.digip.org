<p>
  <a href="/jansson/">Jansson</a> 2.2.1 has been released. This
  release fixes a major bug and little documentation and style issues.
</p>
<p>
  The bug has to do with locales: Jansson's encoder and decoder both
  failed hard on real numbers when the locale's decimal separator was
  not the standard one. Furthermore, the decoder issued invalid error
  messages in some cases under non-UTF-8 locales.
