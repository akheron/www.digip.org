  Today is <a href="/jansson/">Jansson's</a> birthday. The first
  release, Jansson 1.0, was released on August 25, 2009. At that time,
  I thought the library was substantially ready, and there would be
  only few or no new features to be added anymore. I was wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Because I thought that the library was ready and mature, I was bold
  and gave it the version number 1.0. In open source software, it's
  quite common to have 0.x versions for years and years. The safety of
  0.x versions lies in the illusion that you can break backwards
  compatibility in new versions. In my opinion it's like pulling the
  carpet from under the users' feet.
</p>
<p>
  Quite soon it turned out that Jansson wasn't so mature and
  featureful after all. On Jansson's first birthday, version 1.3 had
  been out for two months and there were plenty of new features
  compared to 1.0. But there were a few problems that bugged me, and
  fixing them was not possible without breaking backwards
  compatibility.
</p>
<p>
  It took a long time to make, but version 2.0 was finally released on
  February 28, 2011. It was the first, and hopefully last, backwards
  incompatible version, fixing design mistakes in the 1.x series. For
  the first time, I also tried to prepare for the future; the decoding
  functions got an extra, unused <em>flags</em> parameter for future
  needs. The preparing paid off, as version 2.1 already uses the new
  parameter, and we didn't need another backwards incompatible change
  to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
  What's most remarkable, though, is that there are people out there
  who actually use Jansson to make awesome things happen! The library
  started out as a project to replace existing JSON libraries for C,
  just because none of them was appropriate for my needs. As time
  passed, it turned out that other people had similar needs, and that
  was the driving force for me to fix bugs, add new features, review
  patches, etc. Thank you everyone, without you there wouldn't be
  Jansson as we know it!

  To celebrate the birthday, I was planning to release version 2.2
  today. However, I've been extremely busy
  organizing <a href="http://fi.pycon.org/2011/">PyCon Finland
  2011</a> for the last weeks and months. I really hope to get 2.2 out
  soon.
