Tags: sala announcement

<p>
  I just uploaded <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sala/1.1">sala
    1.1</a> to PyPI. This release adds
    <code>~/.config/sala.conf</code> (or, more
    specifically, <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sala.conf</code>) to the list
    of configuration locations that are read, as per
    the <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG
    Base Directory Specification</a>. Python 2.5 is also now
    supported.

<p>
  I'm also planning to package sala for Ubuntu in the near future.
  Stay tuned.
