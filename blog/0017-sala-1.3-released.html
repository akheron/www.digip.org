<p>
  <a href="/sala/">sala</a> 1.3 is now available
  on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sala/1.3">PyPI</a>!
</p>
<p>
  New features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for hooks, with a post-set hook initially supported.
    Patch by Jyrki Pulliainen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bash completion script for tab-completion
    in <code>$SALADIR</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Other changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Move the repository state to the <code>.sala</code>
    subdirectory. <code>.salakey</code> becomes <code>.sala/key</code>
    and <code>sala.conf</code> becomes <code>.sala/config</code>.
    These files are moved when sala 1.3 is run the first time on an
    old repository. Initial patch by Jyrki Pulliainen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Respect SALADIR when creating subdirectories with <code>set</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When writing this post, I noticed that there was no announcement
  whatsoever for sala 1.2 last December. Even
  sala's <a href="/sala/">homepage</a> wasn't updated! I'll try to pay
  more attention from now on :)
