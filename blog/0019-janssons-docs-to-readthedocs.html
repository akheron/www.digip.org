  <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/">documentation</a> has
  been moved to <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a>,
  an amazing service for hosting
  <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>-powered documentation.
  The documentation of many popular open source projects are already
  hosted on RTD (e.g. <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.org/">pip</a>,
  <a href="https://south.readthedocs.org">South</a>,
  <a href="www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a>), and it seems to be quite
  popular especially among open source Python projects.
</p>
<p>
  The main motivation for me to do this change was the mobile aware
  Sphinx theme. For a long time I've been aware of the the fact that
  Jansson's documentation cannot be viewed nicely with mobile devices,
  so it was about time to fix it. The docs look a bit different now,
  but I think it's a change for the better.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to mobile support, I also got automatic documentation
  builds for all branches. It was as easy as pointing RTD to Jansson's
  <a href="https://github.com/akheron/jansson">git repo</a> and
  selecting tags and branches that get built automatically. GitHub has
  a built-in service hook that rebuilds changed docs each time I push.
  Could it be easier than this?
</p>
<p>
  I hope you like <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/">the new
  documentation</a> as much as I do!
