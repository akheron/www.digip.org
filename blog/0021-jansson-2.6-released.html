<p>
  <a href="/jansson/">Jansson</a> 2.6 was released already on
  2014-02-11, but I totally forgot to blog about it or even update
  Jansson's web page. Sorry about that!
</p>
<p>
  Jansson 2.6 is mainly a security release, changing the hash function
  that is used by Jansson's hashtable implementation. Other changes
  include minor documentation and build system corrections. For a more
  comprehensive list of changes, see
  the <a href="http://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.6/changes.html#version-2-6">release
  notes</a>.

<h3>New hash function</h3>
<p>
  Jansson's old hash function was vulnerable to a denial of service
  attack. By using specially crafted keys, the attacker could reduce
  the performance of most object operations. For example, decoding a
  JSON text with such crafted keys would take tens of seconds for a
  relatively small file.
</p>
<p>
  Jansson 2.6 changes the hash function to Bob Jenkins' lookup3, which
  supports <em>seeding</em>. As no non-cryptographic hash function is
  immune to the key crafting problem, the hash function is seeded by
  random data when the first JSON object is created, either by
  explicitly calling
  <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.6/apiref.html#json_object"><code>json_object()</code></a>,
  or by implicitly creating a new object e.g. by decoding a JSON text
  or
  calling <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.6/apiref.html#json_pack"><code>json_pack()</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of seeding is to make the hash function yield different
  results on each program run. This makes it virtually impossible to
  launch a DoS attack anymore.
</p>
<p>
  The hardest part of seeding is how to actually generate random data
  in a thread-safe manner. Jansson uses <code>/dev/urandom</code> if
  it's available, or <code>CryptGenRandom()</code> on Windows. If
  neither are available, a combination of a microsecond precision
  timestamp and process ID are used as the seed. Seed generation is
  guarded by architecture dependent lock-free operations to ensure
  thread safety.
</p>
<p>
  A new
  function, <a href="https://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.6/apiref.html#json_object_seed"><code>json_object_seed()</code></a>,
  is also exposed, to make it possible for the user to initiate the
  seeding, e.g. before spawning any threads.
